    <p>My name is Alex Fielder, and I am finishing up my final semester at USU. Over the past few years, I have dedicated myself to developing and refining my GIS expertise, gaining hands-on experience in spatial analysis, data visualization, and geospatial technologies. While I’m not currently seeking employment, I invite you to explore my portfolio and welcome you to reach out!</p>
