<summary><b>Post-Wildfire Erosion Paper</b></summary>
<br>
I worked on data cleanup and processing for this paper, working with the DNR and UGRC data sources to help generate a Blue Ribbon fisheries map. The data was surprisingly difficult to source, requiring the linking to and comparing against DNR translation spreadsheets. While I still think that the Fisheries data should be publically available and easy to access, it was a good experience to witness the miscommunication between different state agencies, and how data transfers and is referenced when transferring ownership.

<summary><b>Double Up Food Bucks</b></summary>
<br>
This independent project focused on analyzing the reach and impact of the Double Up Food Bucks Program. The goal was to determine where participants were traveling from to access farmers' markets offering the program. The report details my analytical methods, and I also created a supplemental story map to visualize the findings that you can find <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/3acda68ada4c42d2bacafadd5dd1ed55" target="_blank">here</a>.

<summary><b>Natural Resource Management Plan</b></summary>
<br>
For my final project in Human Dimensions of Natural Resource Management at USU, I developed a strategic plan addressing urban sprawl in Cache County. Utilizing a custom Google Earth Engine script, I gathered reference imagery to support my analysis. As someone deeply passionate about sustainable growth and land use planning, this project was a valuable opportunity to explore solutions for curbing sprawl.
